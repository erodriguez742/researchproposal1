		<h1>Why Digital Writing Matters:</h1>
		<p>Any sort of technology affects the writing standard--writing in the age of the printing press must be approached differently than before that connective web of information was created, and the internet is no different. Resistance to teaching digital writing primarily operates under the assumption of mutually exclusive binaries--that online writing cannot be academic or disciplinary, for example. Not recognizing the connection between subjects and online spaces is irresponsible and counter productive.</p>
		<p>The authors begin by mentioning how new technologies are changing both the practice of writing and the spaces in which we practice writing. Overall, “the ability to compose documents with multiple media, to publish this writing quickly, to distribute it to mass audiences, and to allow audiences to interact with this writing (and with writers) challenges many of the traditional principles and practices of composition, which are based (implicitly) on a print view of writing.” The second focus of the webpage is space, since space shapes the work we do and the ways we interact with eachother. The authors are working on figuring out how we can design non-traditional spaces that provide for communication, collaboration, and intensive work with computers.</p>
		<p>This article is about multimedia options in digital writing and how that changes how teachers use tools and students learn. For students, digital writing programs being used is a lot like introducing movie clips in the classroom. For teachers and those writing for others, auto-fill,images, and charts can make the organization of writing easier with more variety.</p>
		<p>This article mainly focuses on how and why technology should be incorporated into writing classes. The article suggests that the faculty should be more developed around utilizing workshops and training sessions to further incorporate technology classes into writing classes.
The article discusses common counter arguments to teaching digital writing in schools, then dismisses them by showing the largest reason in which it is necessary: to make sure students are equipped with the tools to write in any context for any situation.</p>
		<p>Why teach digital writing? Most—if not all—writing takes place today in computer-mediated spaces. From drafting to presenting to publishing and other forms of production, most documents are digital creations that are frequently created and distributed digitally. And what this means, grand scale, is that writing, today, pushes on institutions in ways that writing has not before pushed.</p>
